This app was made using the flutter package audioplayers.
I learnt how to use external packages in flutter to run audio files to make a xylophone. I used TextButton (one of the MaterialApp button implementations), and the required onPressed parameter I implemented the audio play. I layout is simple, MaterialApp -> Scaffold -> SafeArea -> Column -> Expanded -> Container.
I also learnt => is one way to return in dart functions.
